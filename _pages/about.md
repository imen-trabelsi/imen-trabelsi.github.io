Since January 2021, I have been a PhD student in the Department of Software Engineering at ÉTS, Montreal. I am also a member of the <a href="https://www.ptidej.net/members/">Ptidej research group</a> at Concordia University.

My research focuses on leveraging AI techniques to assist the migration of legacy systems to Microservices. We propose an end-to-end solution that supports developers through this resource-intensive process. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a software engineer, where I developed cognitive games designed to enhance recruitment practices.

I hold a degree in Software Engineering from <a href="https://insat.rnu.tn/">INSAT, Tunisia</a> and a Master’s degree in Data Analysis from <a href="https://enit.rnu.tn/en/home-en/">ENIT, Tunisia</a>.
